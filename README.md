# Basketball Scoreboard Console

## Description
A simple scoreboard console, thought for Basketball.

It features:
- Timer (start/stop)
- Home & Away scoring
- Fouls counter
- Quarter selection

## Stretch Goals
I'm planning for further improvements of this app's functionality, such as:
- Reset timer button;
- Overall Reset button: reset both teams' scores and fouls to 0;
- Abilty to decrease the score by one;
- Sound Effect (?): play a buzzer when timer reaches 0:00
